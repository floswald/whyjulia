# Why Julia?

Julia is the future of scientific computing. This talk is my effort to show why, and to convince people it's worth the time and effort to switch from other languages such as Matlab, Python, C, C++, and Fortran. In particular, I think we should stop teaching those languages to undergraduate scientists and engineers, and start teaching them Julia.

This talk owes a lot to

   * Chris Rackauckas' [Intro to Julia](https://github.com/UCIDataScienceInitiative/IntroToJulia)
   * Andreas Noack's [Fast and Flexible Linear Algebra in Julia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VS0fnUOAKpI)
